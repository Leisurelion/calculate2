# Coding Style Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding style guidelines to be followed when writing code for this project. Consistent coding style ensures readability, maintainability, and collaboration among team members.

## Language

Specify the programming language and version used in the project.

### Example:

- Python 3.8

## Code Formatting

### Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

### Line Length

- Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters.

### Imports

- Group imports into three sections: standard library, third-party, and local imports.
- Sort import statements alphabetically within each section.

### Example:

```python
pythonCopy codeimport os
import sys

import flask
import requests

from mymodule import utility
```

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose.
- Use lowercase with underscores for multi-word variable names (snake_case).

### Constants

- Use uppercase for constant variables.
- Separate words with underscores (CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES).

### Functions

- Use lowercase with underscores for function names (snake_case).
- Use verbs for function names (e.g., `calculate_total()`).

### Classes

- Use CamelCase for class names (PascalCase).

## Comments

- Use comments to explain complex code or provide context where necessary.
- Keep comments up to date, and remove unnecessary or redundant comments.

### Example:

```python
pythonCopy code# This function calculates the total cost
def calculate_total():
    # Initialize the total cost
    total = 0

    # Loop through items and add their prices
    for item in items:
        total += item.price

    return total
```

## Docstrings

- Use docstrings to provide detailed documentation for functions, classes, and modules.
- Follow a consistent format for docstrings. Consider using tools like Sphinx if applicable.

### Example:

```python
pythonCopy codedef calculate_total(items):
    """
    Calculate the total cost of a list of items.

    Args:
        items (list): A list of items, where each item has a 'price' attribute.

    Returns:
        float: The total cost of the items.
    """
```

## Version Control

- Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
- Follow a branching strategy and commit message format (e.g., [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)).
- Keep the repository clean, with only essential files and directories under version control.

## Testing

- Write unit tests to ensure code correctness.
- Follow a naming convention for test files (e.g., `test_*.py`).
- Run tests regularly to catch regressions.

## Additional Guidelines

Include any additional coding style guidelines that are specific to your project, such as:

- Directory structure and organization.
- Framework-specific conventions.
- Error handling and logging practices.
- Security considerations.

## Review Process

Specify how code reviews are conducted, including who performs them and the criteria they follow.

### Example:

- Code reviews will be conducted by team members before merging any changes.
- The reviewer checks for adherence to the coding style guidelines, code quality, and overall correctness.
- Any necessary changes are discussed and resolved during the review.

## Conclusion

Consistent adherence to these coding style guidelines will help maintain code quality and readability throughout the project. Team members are expected to follow these guidelines when contributing to the codebase.
